            <br>
            <p>Custom Automation is a tailored workflow system designed to meet your business's unique requirements. We
                develop and implement solutions that not only resolve your existing challenges, but also allow the
                expansion of your business. These customized workflows will seamlessly integrate into your business
                processes, ultimately enhancing productivity by streamlining tasks and processes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When we talk about automation, one of the key processes we focus on is the onboarding of new clients.
                When a new client signs with us, there are numerous tasks that need to be completed, such as setting up
                invoicing, adding them to our communication platforms like Slack. Implementing an automated workflow for
                these tasks can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete them. Not only does this make a
                positive impression on our clients but it also helps to establish a stronger and more efficient
                relationship with them.
